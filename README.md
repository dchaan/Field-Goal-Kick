# Scatter-Ball

Game: 
<br>Scatter Ball (carnival game)

Background: 
<br>
Scatter Ball is a classic game, usually seen at carnivals or amusement parks. The idea of the game is to catch all of the balls (marbles) that fall from the top of the game board with a basket at the bottom of the game board. The game board is filled with pegs (dividers) that cause the marbles to have an almost random path down to the bottom, making it challenging to catch the marbles.

Functionality & MVPs: 
<br>
In Scatter Ball, users will be able to:
Start, stop and pause the game
Move the basket horizontally in order to catch the marbles
Experience increased difficulty as more marbles are caught

In addition, this project will include:
