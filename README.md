# [Scatter Ball](https://dchaan.github.io/Scatter-Ball/)

Scatter Ball is a classic game, usually seen at carnivals or amusement parks. The idea of the game is to catch all of the balls that fall from the top of the game board with the basket at the bottom of the game board. The balls collide with pegs, making it challenging for the user to map out where the balls might fall. Each ball caught is worth 1 point and each ball missed results in losing a life.
