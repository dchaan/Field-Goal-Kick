Background: 
<br>
Scatter Ball is a classic game, usually seen at carnivals or amusement parks. The idea of the game is to catch all of the balls (marbles) that fall from the top of the game board with a basket at the bottom of the game board. The game board is filled with pegs (dividers) that cause the marbles to have an almost random path down to the bottom, making it challenging to catch the marbles.
